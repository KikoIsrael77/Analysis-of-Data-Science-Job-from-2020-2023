In the rapidly evolving field of data science, understanding the factors that influence job salaries is crucial for professionals and employers alike. With Python being a popular programming language in the data science community, it offers a powerful toolset for conducting comprehensive analyses. 
This study focuses on analyzing data science job salaries in 2023 using Python. By examining various factors such as job titles, experience levels, educational qualifications, and geographical locations, we aim to uncover insights into the salary landscape of the data science industry. 
The findings of this analysis will provide valuable information for both aspiring data scientists and organizations seeking to attract and retain top talent.

Data analysis has emerged as a prominent occupation in the technology industry, contributing significantly to the global economy.
The exponential growth of data generation in recent years has led to a demand for professionals skilled in data science. Data science utilizes statistics, mathematics, scientific methods, computer programming, machine learning, deep learning, and other techniques to extract knowledge, uncover insights, and identify patterns from large, unstructured datasets. 
The expansion of this field has created numerous job opportunities worldwide, making data science one of the most sought-after career paths today.
The growth trajectory of this field is expected to continue due to the increasing need for analyzing vast amounts of data. Within data science, there are diverse job titles that exist. To gain insights into these job titles and their corresponding salaries, a dataset comprising 3755 job titles from companies across the globe will be analyzed through a series of question-based analyses.
This analysis aims to identify the key factors influencing the relationship between job titles and their associated salaries.
